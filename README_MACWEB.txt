This project was created during a Drupal class I was taking.  It uses the Danland 
theme which require a small modification of the page.tpl.php file.  On line 255, the
Danland <div id="notice"> was commented out and replaced with a MACWEB related 
<div id="notice">.  The replacement paragraph was as follows:
<p><strong><em>Mims Areo Club</em> - Come Fly with us and work on some really Great 
Planes.</strong></p>
