Installation
------------

* Copy the module into your sites/all/modules directory.
* Go to admin/modules and enable the weather module.

Configuration
-------------

* If you want to have a system-wide weather block (i.e. the same
  location for every user), go to Administer->Configuration->Weather
  and add a display. Afterwards, you can add as much locations
  as you like to that display. Go to Administer->Structure->Blocks
  and enable the "Weather: system-wide display (number 1)" block.
* If you want to allow users to configure their own custom weather
  blocks, go to Administer->Structure->Blocks and enable the
  "Weather: custom user" block. You might want to change the
  "Visibility settings" in the configuration page of the block to
  "Customizable, hidden by default." in the "User" tab.
  Afterwards, go to Administer->People and switch to the "Permission"
  tab. Set the "Administer custom weather block" permission for the
  appropriate role.
* If you want visitors of your site to have the possibility of searching
  for weather reports, you can set the "Access weather pages" permission
  for the appropriate roles.
